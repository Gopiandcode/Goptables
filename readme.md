# Goptables
> If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.

Goptables is, at its core, a timetabling application for constructing clear and concise schedules for personal and professional use. 
Simply specify the types of tasks you want to allocate your time to, the distribution of breaks that most appropriately suits your work style, and let the automated algorithm construct a "goptastic" schedule for you.


## Description
Throughout my time at academia, 
I've relied heavily on carefully constructed schedules to maxise the use of my time.
I don't know why, but I've always found my productivity is maximised when I have a clear and structured timetable to follow.

Before Goptables, I would usually plan out such a schedule in a spreadsheet tool - during High School before I learned to code, I'd use Excel, but then slowly transitioned to Google spreadsheets.
However these tools, while overwhelming in their breadth, were ill-suited for such a task, their inflexibility requiring extensive boilerplate formulae every time before a schedule could be defined.
Additionally,  once I'd come up with a set of working and break times, they lacked any way of automatically randomly assigning tasks 
in such a way so as to meet my own personal criteria, and even more embarassingly I would then resort to assigning tasks by manually filling in cells. developing a personal heuristic for an optimal assignment.

Over the years I became quite good at setting up such timetables, even going so far as to engrave the exact commands needed to efficiently set up a timetable into my muscle memory.
You could say that things were fine enough.

But! A Computer Scientist does not settle for "fine enough". 

Hence, I present Goptables. The best timetabling tool you never knew you needed.

## Features
 - Automatically generate schedules optimised for productivity (using Gopiandcode's custom schedule productivity heuristic)
 - Generated schedules prioritize tasks based on personal weightings.
 - Visualize timetables in a graphical way, and clearly view the distribution of the length of breaks
 - Export timetables to Google Calandar, with reminder notifications at the end of each task.
 - Manually modify generated timetables to fit your needs.
